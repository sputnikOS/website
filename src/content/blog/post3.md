### Intelligence
Intelligence is the collecting and processing of information about a competitive entity and its agents, needed by an organization or group for its security and well-being. Intelligence is both a product and a process.

**Cyber Threat Intelligence** is defined as analyzed information about the hostile intent, capability, and opportunity of an adversary that satisfies a requirement. The focus is on the human threat.

### The Intelligence Cycle
#### Dissemination --> Planning and Direction ---> Collection --> Processing and Exploitation --> Analysis and Production --> Return to Dissemination

### Structuring Your Team to Generate Intelligence
#### Intelligence Team:
- Security Operations Center
- Incident Response
- System Engineering & IT
- Business Operations
- Vulnerability Management

### Planning and Direction Fundamentals
- **Intelligence Requirements** - request to satisfy a knowledge gap about the threat or operational environment. Objectives that analysts seek to satisfy through the intelligence process. **Example**: 
	**Strategic**: What business units are at most risk to cyber crime?
	**Operational**: What activity groups are currently active in our industry?
	**Tactical**: What adversary behaviors should security focus on to identify threats that are the most likely to breach our organization?
- **Threat Modeling**
	**Your Organization**
	- Financial Data  --> (Activity Group A)
	- Intellectual Property --> (Activity Group A/B)
	- System Availability --> (Activity Group C)
-  **Collection Management Framework**
	- Analysts must understand where they are getting data, how it is processed and delivered to them, and what questions can they reasonably ask of the data.
	- A **Collection Management Framework** is a view of sources of data, what is available in the data, and how that data is processed and exploited

### Collection 
#### Key Collection Sources
- **Intrusion Analysis**
	- Look to your own internal information
	- Describes stages of a single intrusion
	- Seven stages to defend
- **Malware Collection**
	- Historically, public threat intelligence reports have been malware reports.
		- Strong focus on malware analysis in the community.
		- Can be misleading as a sole source of collection, but can be highly valuable.
	- Leveraged by organizations as a free malware sandbox.
		- Makes the data available to others, including adversaries
	- Some popular sites:
		- VirusTotal
		- Hybrid-Analysis
		- Joe Sandbox
	- Can create your own
	- Useful as a CTI collection source
- **Domains**
	- **Identify** all relevant indicators
	- **Start** with single indicator
	- **Pivot** through each data source and add relevant data points
		- C2 Domain
		- Registrant Data
		- IP Resolution
		- Samples calling back to it
	- **Validate** ensure links contain context and are meaningful
	
- **External Datasets**
	- Usually exist in the form of IP addresses, digital hashes, filenames, and other Atomic and Computed threat indicators
	- Key Aspects:
		- Where is the data coming from?
		- Is the data applicable to the type of threats your organization cares about?
		- How is the data going to be used?
	- Highly trusted sources' threat data can be plugged directly into many organization's security architecture to actively identify or block validated threats, but **be cautious**
	- **Measuring Threat Feeds**
		- Plus:
			- Pivots into higher-order context
			- Is focused on your industry threats
			- Has well-articulated understanding of the Collection Management Framework feeding it
			- Openly values quality and accuracy over quantity and speed
		- Minus:
			- Ever contains RFC 1918 addresses or public trusted domains like Microsoft.com
			- No context behind info
			- Expectation is plug and play
- **TLS Certificates**
	- A digital certificate used in secure host-to-host network communications (previously SSL)
	- Collection of TLS certificates (free/paid)
	- Can be used to find C2 infrastructure
### Processing & Exploitation
#### Structured Models: Data into Buckets
- Structured models are useful to analysts for many reasons, but a chief reason is simple: **data into buckets**
	- Allows for the abstraction of the analyst and identification of patterns
	- Kill Chain, Diamond Model, MITRE ATT&CK, VERIS
		- **Diamond Model**
			- Infrastructure
			- Adversary
			- Capability/TTP
			- Victim
		- **MITRE ATT&CK** is a documentation of tactics and techniques
			- A useful framework for expressing and documenting tactics and techniques
			- Supported by MITRE and contributed to through many in the community
			- Focuses on tactics and techniques that have been observed in the real world
	- **Storing Collected Intel**
		- Often discussed in the context of threat intelligence platform
		- The focus is on storing information in a quickly accessible and useful format
		- Pros and Cons to each--consider your requirements!
	- **Storing Platforms**
		- Open Source
			- CRITS
			- MISP
			- Threat_Note
			- YETI
		- Pros: Free, ample storage, open source sharing communities
		- Cons: Difficult to implement and maintain

### Analysis and Production
#### Identifying and Defeating Bias
- All analysts have bias
- Cognitive biases are constraints on how we as analysts think that influence incorrect decisions, assessments, or rationale
- They allow analysts to create their own version of reality where inaccurate judgements and illogical interpretations occur
#### Confirmation Bias
- Selectively Supporting One Hypothesis
- Evidence Inclusion
	- Seek supporting evidence
	- Reject refuting evidence
- Significance Biasing
	- Greater significance to supporting data
	- Lesser significance to contradicting data
#### Structured Analytic Techniques
- Structured Analytic Techniques (SATs) are analyst approaches to better evaluate information while reducing the impact of bias
	- Analysts leverage models to abstract data as much as possible from ourselves
	- Sample SATs:
		- Analysis of Competing Hypotheses
		- Devil's Advocacy
		- Team A/Team B
		- Brainstorming
		- Red Team Analysis
#### Analysis: Correlating Clusters
- Many terms for clusters: 
	- threat actors 
	- **activity groups** are unique clusters of intrusions mathematically defined by the analyst/team's analytical weighting (confidence scoring) 
	- campaigns, 
	- intrusion sets
- Different methodologies to do this
### Dissemination
#### **Assessment = confidence + analysis + evidence + sources**
- #### Know your Audience!
- #### Intended Audience
	- Intended audience and their goals determine the type of threat intelligence generated and how it is used (strategic, operational, tactical)
- #### Constructing Assessments
	- Can be viewed as an equation
	- **Assessment = confidence + analysis + evidence + sources**
	- **We assess with <confidence> that <assessment> because of <evidence> <insert sources>**
		- High Confidence:
			- Supported by preponderance of evidence
			- No evidence against
			- All but certain
		- Moderate Confidence
			- Significant evidence missing
			- New evidence could invalidate
		- Low Confidence
			- Other equally likely hypotheses exist
			- Little evidence available to support
