An airgap network is a security measure that physically isolates a computer or network from unsecured systems, including the internet. This prevents remote access, cyberattacks, and unauthorized data transfers.
Key characteristics:
- Physical isolation: No direct wired or wireless connections to external networks.
- Manual data transfer: Information is moved via removable media (e.g., USB drives).
- High security: Used in critical infrastructure, military, and financial systems.
- Unidirectional gateways: Some setups use data diodes to allow one-way data flow while preventing backflow.
  Despite its effectiveness, airgap security can be bypassed through physical access, electromagnetic emissions, or malware introduced via external devices.
