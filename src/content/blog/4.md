# SANS DFIR101: Digital Forensics Essentials
### What is Digital Evidence
- Digital evidence is simply the information that is stored or transmitted in a digital format that may be of value to an investigation
### Data vs Metadata
- **Data** is "information based in digital form that can be transmitted or processed"[1]
- **Metadata** is "information that provides information about other data"[2]
	- **Types of Metadata**
		- **Filesystem Metadata (Filesystem Dependent)**
			- Example: filename, file creation datetime, file content modification datetime
			- **File Data**
				- The actual contents of a particular file
			- **File Metadata (File Type Dependent**
				- Example: last printed datetime, author, last saved, etc.
### Nature of Digital Evidence
- In order to understand digital evidence and correctly interpret its potential relevance to an investigation, it is vitally important to understand how this evidence is stored on a device.
- #### How Data is Stored
	####  **Applications --> Operating System --> Filesystem --> Sectors and Clusters --> Bits and Bytes**
	-  Data is stored on a device in binary; that is, zeroes and ones
		- A single zero/one is called a "bit"
		- Bits are grouped into sets of eight, called "bytes"
	- Numbering Systems
		- In decimal, we have "base10"
		- In Hexidecimal (or hex), we have base16
	- **Sectors**
		- Data on a disk is stored in sectors and clusters
		- The number of bytes in a sector is defined in the filesystem header
			- Example: NTFS (512 byte sector), APFS (512 byte sector)
	- **Allocated and Unallocated Space**
		- Each cluster is labeled by the OS as either allocated or unallocated:
			- **Allocated:** cluster is currently allocated to a file
			- **Unallocated:** cluster is NOT currently allocated to a file
		- An unallocated cluster does NOT indicate it has never been previously allocated to any files
	- **Slack Space**
		- Since a cluster is the smallest addressable space, a new file is created in one or more clusters.
		- If the entirety of this space is not occupied by the file, remaining space cannot be used by another file.
		- The remaining space is called "**slack space**"
	- **Types of Slack Space**
		- **RAM Slack**: unused space between the end of the logical file and the end of that sector
		- **File Slack**: unused sectors within the last cluster the file occupies.
		- **Volume Slack**: unused space between the end of the filesystem and the end of the partition that it occupies.
